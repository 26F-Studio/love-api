The complete API documentation of [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) contained in a lua table.

The project was originally started by [Santos](https://www.love2d.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=3835) who did a majority of the work. He gave his [permission](https://www.love2d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=1796&start=60#p166919) to host the project online.

The API information is updated manually based on the [LÖVE-Wiki](https://love2d.org/wiki). Therefore there is no guarantee that everything is correct and up to date. If you find any errors, outdated information or missing content, please file a [bug report](https://github.com/rm-code/love-api/issues) or create a [pull request](https://github.com/rm-code/love-api/pulls).

Contributions are more than welcome!
